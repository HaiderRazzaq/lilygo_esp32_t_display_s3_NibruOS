# Development log

Append-only engineering records, created in increasing ID order. Imported
events retain their supported event date or UNKNOWN; `date` is when this record
was written. No missing development chronology has been reconstructed. Git is
the authority for code diffs; these records preserve reasoning and test evidence.
Corrections must be appended with the original ID reference.
